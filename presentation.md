this option is the most hands off long term option. You will get support for any issues that arrise or small changes you need to the website that you can't do yourself via the management dashboard.

whichever option you choose, you will have a garantee for a fully functioning website, so if there are any issues with the initial setup I will fix them at no additional charge.

I am raising funds, so this offer is discounted until the end of 2025. It will still be availabel for you at any time after that, but the 50% discount will no longer apply and the website source code will offered at my normal rate at R3000.

This is a very good value proposition given the powerful and user friendly menu management tools I have custom built specifically for your business, so I hope you will take this special offer into consideration.
